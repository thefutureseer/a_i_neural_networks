1. Feedforward neural networks: These are the simplest type of neural network, in which information flows in only one direction, from input nodes through one or more hidden layers to output nodes.

2. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs): CNNs are commonly used for image recognition and processing. They use a convolutional layer to filter and transform the input data before passing it on to a fully connected layer.

3. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): RNNs are designed to handle sequential data, such as time series or natural language processing. They use feedback loops to process information from previous time steps.

4. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks: LSTMs are a type of RNN that are specifically designed to handle long-term dependencies. They use memory cells to store information over time.

5. Autoencoders: Autoencoders are used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. They learn to compress and decompress input data without the need for explicit labels.

6. Generative adversarial networks (GANs): GANs are used for generating new data that is similar to a given dataset. They consist of two networks: a generator that creates new data, and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real and generated data.

7. Deep belief networks (DBNs): DBNs are a type of feedforward neural network that use unsupervised learning to build a hierarchy of feature detectors. They are often used for image and speech recognition.

8. Hopfield networks: Hopfield networks are used for associative memory tasks. They store patterns and can recall them from incomplete or noisy inputs.
